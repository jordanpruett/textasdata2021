# textasdata2021
Teaching materials for a 2021 English literature course I taught introducing basic text analysis tools used for humanities research, including Voyant, 
topic modeling, text classification, sentiment analysis, and word vector models. 

# textClassification.ipynb
A Google colab notebook that lets the students upload two classes of text, train a classifier to distinguish them with TF-IDF and logistic regression,
then view the top 100 words associated with each class. We used short stories from the "golden age" of pulp fiction (1895-1940), but you can any text files
that can be separated categorically.
