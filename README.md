# textasdata2021
Teaching materials for a 2021 English literature course I taught introducing computational text analysis methods for research, including
topic modeling, text classification, and word vector models. 

# NLTKworkbook.ipynb
An introductory notebook introducing students to basic NLP functionality in NLTK (natural language toolkit). It also includes a demonstration of the "semantic cohort" method [described by Ryan Heuser and Long Le-Khac.](https://litlab.stanford.edu/LiteraryLabPamphlet4.pdf)

# textClassification.ipynb
A notebook that lets the students upload two classes of text, train a classifier to distinguish them with TF-IDF and logistic regression,
then view the top 100 words associated with each class. We used short stories from the "golden age" of pulp fiction (1895-1940), but you can any texts
that can be separated categorically.

# topicModeling.ipynb
This notebook introduces to students to topic modeling using scikit-learn, using an Associated Press corpus as an introduction.
